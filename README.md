# ushell
Implement the micro-shell, ush (ie, μ-shell).

# DESCRIPTION
ush is a command interpreter with a syntax similar to UNIX C shell, csh(1). However, it is for instructional
purposes only, therefore it is much simpler.
Initialization and Termination
When first stared, ush normally performs commands from the file ˜/.ushrc, provided that it is readable.
Commands in this file are processed just the same as if they were taken from standard input.
Interactive Operation
After startup processing, an interactive ush shell begins reading commands from the terminal, prompting
with hostname%. The shell then repeatedly performs the following actions: a line of command input is
read and broken into words; this sequence of words is parsed (as described under Usage); and the shell
executes each command in the current line.
#USAGE
##Lexical Structure
The shell splits input lines into words separated by whitespace (spaces or tabs), with the following exceptions:
The special characters &, |, ;, <, and > and the multi-character sequences >>, |&, >& and >>& are
always separate words, whether or not they are surrounded by whitespace.
Special characters preceded by a backslash character (\) are not interpreted by the shell. Tw o backslashes
together sends the backslash character to the shell; otherwise the backslash is stripped from the
input.
Characters enclosed in double quotes (") or single quotes (’) form a single word. Special characters
inside of strings do not form separate words.
##Command Line Parsing
A simple command is a sequence of words, the first of which specifies the command to be executed. A
pipeline is a sequence of one or more simple commands separated by | or |&. With |, the standard output of
the preceding command is redirected to the standard input of the command that follows. With |&, both the
standard error and the standard output are redirected through the pipeline.
A list is a sequence of one or more pipelines separated by ; or &. Pipelines joined into sequences with ;
will be executed sequentially. Pipelines ending with & are executed asynchronously. In which case, the
shell does not wait for the pipeline to finish; instead, it displays the job number (see Job Control) and associated
process ID, and begins processing the subsequent pipelines (prompting if necessary).
##I/O Redirection
The following separators indicate that the subsequent word is the name of a file to which the command’s
standard input, standard output, or standard error is redirected.
< Redirect the standard input.
>, >& Redirect the standard output to a file. If file does not exist, it is created. If it does exist, it is overwritten
and its previous contents are lost. The & form redirects both standard output and standard
error to the file.
>>, >>&
Append the standard output. Like >, but places output at the end of the file rather than overwriting.
The & form appends both standard output and standard error to the file.
##Command Execution
If the command is an ush shell built-in, the shell executes it directly. Otherwise, the shell searches for a file
by that name with execute access. If the command-name contains a /, the shell takes it as a pathname and
searches for it. If a pathname begins with a /, then the path is absolute; otherwise, the path is relative to the
current working directory. If the command-name does not contain a /, the shell attempts to resolve it to a
pathname, searching each directory in the PATH variable for the command.
When a file, with its pathname resolved, is found that has proper execute permission, the shell forks a new
process to run the command. The shell also passes along any arguments to the command. Using one of the
flavor of exec system call, such as execv(2V), the newly forked process attempts to overlay the desired program.
If successful, the shell is silent.
If the file does not have execute permissions, or if the pathname matches a directory, a ‘‘permission denied’’
message is displayed. If the pathname cannot be resolved a ‘‘command not found’’ message is displayed. If
either of these errors occurs with any component of a pipeline the entire pipeline is aborted, even though
some of the pipeline may already be executing.
Environment Variables
Environment variables may be accessed via the setenv built-in commands. When a program is exec’d the
environment variables are passed as parameters to execv or equivalent.
##Signal Handling
The shell ignores QUIT signals. Background jobs are immune to signals generated from the keyboard,
including hangups (HUP).
##Builtin commands
Built-in commands are executed within ush. If a built-in command occurs as any component of a pipeline
except the last, it is executed in a subshell.
*cd [dir] Change the working directory of the shell to dir, provided it is a directory and the shell has the
appropriate permissions. Without an argument, it changes the working directory to the original
(home) directory.
*echo word ...
Writes each word to the shell’s standard output, separated by spaces and terminated with a newline.
*logout Exits the shell.
*nice [[+/-]number] [command]
Sets the scheduling priority for the shell to number, or, without number, to 4. With command,
runs command at the appropriate priority. The greater the number, the less cpu the process gets.
If no sign before the number, assume it is positive.
*pwd Prints the current working directory.
*setenv [VAR [word]]
Without arguments, prints the names and values of all environment variables. Given VAR, sets
the environment variable VAR to word or, without word, to the null string.
*unsetenv VAR
Removes environment variable whose name matches VAR.
where command
Reports all known instances of command, including builtins and executables in path
